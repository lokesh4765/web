        One of the most sacred pilgrimage sites in India is Badrinath. Located at a height of 3133 m, in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand state, this Sacred Dham was established by Adi Shankaracharya during the 9th Century.
        <br>
        As one of the destinations of Chardham Yatra, Badhrinath Temple is a popular pilgrimage site where, every year, thousands of religious tourists gather here for getting blessed and worshipping deity Lord Vishnu. The holy shrine is built very close to the sacred Alaknanda River.
        <br>
        A place, which holds so many myths and legends, Badrinath acquires predominance in the travel itinerary of a pilgrim. The popular belief is that Badarinath was the domain of Lord Shiva, and Lord Vishnu managed to unseat Shiva from here to Kedarnath. Another belief is that when Ganga made her descend to earth she split up in to twelve streams and one among the channels, Alakananda felt on Kedarnath. Sanctity and holiness of Badrinath festooned it with accolades since from the Vedic ages. This sacred abode of Nara-Narayana sages had been a revered seat and the Vedas like Srimad Bhagavatam, gave testimony to its devoutness.
        <br>
It is not just shrines and pilgrimage that Badrinath offers. It proffers the awesome beauty of the snow clad mountain peaks and the surging landscapes of the Garhwal region. It is a scenic place with picture book sceneries, undulating peaks, sacred ponds and water bodies, Badrinath makes the visitor spellbound with its unparalleled gorgeousness. This majestic look of Badrinath is attributed much by the presence of the magnificent rivers Rishi Ganga and Alaknanda. Apart from the natural beauty, Badrinath presents excellent opportunity for those who love escapades and recreational activities.
